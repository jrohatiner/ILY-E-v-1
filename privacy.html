  <strong>Personal information you give us. </strong>
  We collect three categories of personal information - personal information you give us; personal information automatically collected from your use of the Services; and personal information from third-party sources.

  <h2.private>information you give us</h2.private>
  <p>We collect information you voluntarily share with us, such as when you create an account, make a booking, request assistance from our customer support team, or sign up to receive our emails. This may include:
  <strong>Account data. </strong> When you register for an account with us, we require certain personal information to open your account, such as your name, email address, and password.
  Profile data. We may also ask you to provide additional profile information to use certain features of the Services which may include street addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license number, date of issuance and issuing country and/or state, profile photos, employer, city, school, biography, and date of birth. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile photos, employer, city, school, and biography) are part of your public profile page and will be publicly visible to others.
    <strong>Vehicle data.  </strong> We collect information you provide in relation to a vehicle such as vehicle listing details, vehicle identification number (VIN), availability dates, reviews, and uploaded trip photos.
   <strong> Payment data  </strong>. We collect your digital payment details, bank account or payment card numbers, and transaction information in connection with a potential or actual transaction, which may be processed and stored by one or more third party payment service providers or digital payments companies.
    <strong>Identity verification data.  </strong> In some instances, we may collect identity verification information such as a photograph or scanned copy of a driver’s license, passport, national ID card, or payment card, last four digits of your Social Security number, social insurance number, social media account information, driver’s/motor vehicle record, insurance information, or other forms of identification information. Where we request that you withhold certain information (such as obscuring or redacting aspects of identification information), please do so. To learn more, visit our Help Center article about Getting Approved to Drive.

    <strong>Cookies and similar technology.  </strong> When you access the Services, we (including companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, clear gifs, pixel tags, e-tags, “Flash cookies”, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively “Cookies”). For more detailed information on our use of these technologies, please see our policy on Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies. At this time, we do not respond to browser ‘Do-Not-Track’ signals.</p>
    <h2.private>Personal information we collect from third-party sources.</h2.private>
   <p><strong> Third-party services.  </strong> If you choose to log in to our Services through a third-party site or service (e.g., Apple, Facebook, or Google), the third-party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. The information we may receive varies by service and is controlled by the relevant service. By associating an account managed by a third party with your ILY-E account and authorizing ILY-E to have access to this information, you agree that ILY-E may collect, store, and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for how those third parties use and share your information. Please refer to the privacy policies of those third parties to understand how they use and share your personal information.
    <strong>Third-party in-vehicle devices.   </strong>If your vehicle, or a vehicle you book through the Services, includes an in-vehicle device or system operated by a third-party service (including vehicle manufacturers) or installed by the host, that host or service may record information about your use of the car. These devices or systems may monitor the car's condition, performance and operation, track fuel consumption, distance traveled, location, and other information. The host and/or third-party service will be solely responsible for its use of such information but may disclose such information to ILY-E, which we will use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  Background check services. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, ILY-E may collect background information about you from public records, background check providers, or other screening services, including credit reports and information about criminal convictions or from sex offender registries. We may use your information, including your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports.
    <strong>Other sources.   </strong>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, fraud detection information, or data from credit bureaus and other third-party data providers.
  We may combine the information about you that we receive from third-party sources with other information we have about you.

These ads are known as “interest-based advertisements”. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising, in the Interest-based advertising choices section below.

    <strong>With your consent:  </strong>
  In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to process your personal information.
  We may also use your personal information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.
  How we disclose your personal information
  With your consent
  We may share your information at your direction or with your consent.
    <strong>Profiles, listings, and other public information  </strong>
  Your public listing page on the Services will always include some basic information, such as your user ID or name associated with your account, your public profile photo, and for hosts, the city where your car is located, your listing description, your calendar availability, transaction related information to allow our community to evaluate your reliability and responsiveness, and reviews or feedback about you. Your public listing page may also include aggregate demand information (such as number of page views over a period of time) and information about your cancellations. The Services may also display the approximate geographic pick-up location of your vehicle.
  The Services allow your public profile and public listing pages to be included in search engines, in which case your public profile and public listing pages may be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results.
    <strong>Sharing between hosts and guests  </strong>
  ILY-E enables car owners to offer and share their vehicles with other individuals. If you agree to a booking through the Services, we may provide your information to the other party in that transaction as reasonably necessary to facilitate the transaction. For example, ILY-E may provide your mobile phone number to facilitate communication, your driver's license information to confirm license validity, or your photograph to facilitate identification. We will also share the address of the vehicle and, if applicable, the proposed delivery location with the other party. If you used the Trip Photo feature, we may share the trip photos you upload and associated captions with the other party. The other party may also send you text messages (such as to confirm pickup or delivery location). Standard telephone minute and text and data charges may apply.
   <strong> Service providers  </strong>
  We may share information with vendors and service providers who support the operation of the Services and business and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us (including, for example, web hosting, analytics, payment processing, email delivery, marketing, insurance, claims administration, and customer support services). In some cases, the service provider may directly collect the information from you on our behalf. For hosts who choose to use our photography program, your contact information will be shared with the photographer assigned to shoot your vehicle. These service providers may use your personal information only as directed or authorized by us.
    <strong>Third-party platforms and social media networks  </strong>
  If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network (such as by logging in to the Services using your account with the third party, providing your API key or similar access token for the Services to a third party, or otherwise linking your Services account to a third-party’s services), we may disclose to the third-party platform or social media network the personal information necessary to facilitate the connection or that you authorized us to share. We do not control the third party’s use of your personal information.
    <strong>Professional advisors  </strong>
  We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.
  <strong>Business Transfers</strong> 
  We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your personal information, in connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.
  Responding to legal requests, preventing harm, and protecting our rights
  We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or tax authorities, or third parties. We will make such disclosure to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by applicable law or where we consider such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations or legal process, to respond to claims asserted against us, and for the security and safety purposes described above. We may also disclose your information in response to valid legal requests relating to criminal investigations or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose ILY-E, you, or any other user, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ILY-E, our users, or others.
  We may also disclose your personal information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.
  Your preferences and choices
  <strong>Communication preferences </strong>
  You can control the methods by which we may contact you about your account, your booking and listing activities, promotions, and announcements in the Notifications section within your ILY-E account.
    <strong>Opting out of marketing communications </strong>
  You may opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails. If you receive marketing text messages from us, you may opt out of receiving further marketing text messages from us by replying STOP to our marketing message or as described in the message.
    <strong>Correct and update </strong>
  You can review, correct, update, and edit certain information that has been previously provided to us by you at any time by logging in to your account and reviewing your account settings and profile. You can also access or request a correction of your information by contacting us at support.ILY-E.com. For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.
    <strong>Account closure </strong>
  If you wish to close your account and request deletion of your personal information, please send an email to accountclosure@ILY-E.com or contact us at support.ILY-E.com.
  Please note that we may be unable to delete information needed to comply with applicable laws, detect or prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, assist with or process claims, troubleshoot problems, assist with any audits and investigations, to enforce our Terms of Service and Policies, and take other actions reasonably necessary, permitted, or required by applicable law. There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.
    <strong>Access </strong>
  You can request a copy of your personal information pursuant to any information access rights that you may have under applicable laws in your account page. We may request proof of identification or re-authentication to verify your access request.
    <strong>Location data </strong>
  Users of our mobile application can disable the application’s access to the device’s location within the device’s settings.
    <strong>Interest-based advertising choices </strong>
  Your choices for limiting use of your personal information for interest-based advertising include:
    <strong>Blocking cookies in your browser. </strong>Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
    <strong>Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings.  </strong> Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device (e.g., Apple ID for Advertising or Google Advertising ID) for interest-based advertising purposes.
  <strong>Using privacy plug-ins or browsers.   </strong>You can block sites from setting cookies for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy features, like Brave, or installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger, Ghostery, or uBlock Origin, and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers.
  <strong>Advertising industry opt-out tools.  </strong> You can also use these opt-out options to limit use of your information for interest-based advertising by participating companies (but note we may work with companies that do not participate in these programs):
  • European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (for users in the United Kingdom and Europe)
<ul>
  <li>Digital Advertising Alliance for web users</li>
    <li>Digital Advertising Alliance for mobile app users</li>
   <li> Network Advertising Initiative</li>
</ul>
  <h2.private>Choosing not to share your personal information</h2.private>
 <p> Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or
    where we need your personal information in order to provide the Services
   to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or we later delete it at your request),
   we may not be able to provide you with the Services.</p>
  <strong>transfers</strong>Third-party platforms and social media networks
  If you choose to connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network, such as by using the third party’s authentication service to log into your account on the Services, you may be able to control your settings through the third-party platform or social media network. If you withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.
    <strong>Security</strong>
  We employ a number of technical, physical, and organizational measures designed to protect information against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration while it is under our control. However, no method of transmitting or storing information can be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
<section>
  <h2.private>Other important information</h2.private>
  <p><strong>Cross border transfer</strong>
  The Services are controlled and operated from the United States. Your personal information may be used, stored, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. These locations may be outside of your state, province, or country of residence, and may have different and/or less protective data protection rules than those of your state, province, or country. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, regulatory agencies, security authorities, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to the laws in those jurisdictions.
    <strong>Sensitive information </strong>
  We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive information (e.g., Social Security numbers, social insurance numbers, passports, information related to racial or ethnic origin, or health) on or through the Services or otherwise to us unless specifically requested.
    <strong>Children </strong>
  The Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from users under the age of 18. If a child under the age of 18 has already provided us with personal information, his or her parent or guardian may contact us to request that we delete it.
   <strong> Third-party privacy practices</strong>
  This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information collected by ILY-E. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third-party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.
  Translations
  Where ILY-E has provided you with a version of this Privacy Policy in a language other than English, in case of any wording discrepancies between such version and the English version, the English wording takes precedence.
  Changes to this privacy policy
  We may change this Privacy Policy. Please take a look at the “Last revised” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services or as otherwise indicated. Your use of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these changes, you can contact us to close your account.
  Contact
  ILY-E welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please feel free to contact us at our address in the United States.
  You may also email us.
